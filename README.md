# AWS Polly Text-to-Speech Converter 🎤

A cloud-based **Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application** built using **AWS Polly** and **Next.js**.
This project converts user-provided text into **natural, human-like speech** using neural voices and allows users to **listen to and download audio in MP3 format**.

## 🧩 Project Architecture (High Level)

1. User enters text in the web UI
2. Frontend sends a POST request to backend API
3. Backend validates input and voice selection
4. AWS Polly converts text to speech
5. Audio stream is returned as Base64 MP3
6. Frontend plays and allows download of audio

## 🔐 Environment Variables

AWS credentials are **not stored in GitHub**.

Create a `.env.local` file on the server:

```env
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` files to GitHub.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🌍 Deployment (EC2)

* Ubuntu Server on AWS EC2
* Node.js installed
* Project runs on a public IPv4 address
* Security Group allows application port access
* App listens on `0.0.0.0` for public access

---

## 📊 Output

* 🎧 Users can listen to generated speech directly in the browser
* ⬇️ Users can download the audio in MP3 format
* 🎙️ Users can switch between different voice tones

---

## 📌 Limitations
